STATIC and MEDIA

1. In everyweb app, a developer encounters terms "media" and "static"
2. When both of these terms look similar to asstes (photos, videos, css, js, etc.), there is slight difference between them.
3. Static are the fixed assets in an application (eg. logo, css, js) 
    whereas, media are the user uploads (profile picture, video files)
